# Cryptocurrencies

# Summary

In this analysis, unsupervised machine learning was applied to cryptocurrency data.  After data preprocessing, principal component analysis (PCA) was used for reducing data dimensions.  K-means analysis was then implemented for clustering analysis.  Labels from the clustering analysis were then matched up with PCA features, cryptocurrency features, and cryptocurrency names.  In this way, predicted cryptocurrencies (ie learned) were identified. Finally, the power of hvplot was used to visualize the tradable crytopcurrencies.
